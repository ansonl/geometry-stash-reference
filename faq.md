#### Opening a [Bulk Import File](bulk-import/) is crashing/not importing. 

  * Make sure you have specified the correct [`type` key value](http://geometrystash.com/bulk-import/#type) in the import file's root dictionary. Geometry Stash will treat files according to this value. 
  * Null values in a JSON file can cause problems for Geometry Stash. You verify that your JSON file is in the correct format with a web app such as [JSON Editor Online](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org).


#### Exporting a slide as an image cuts off some of the text.

  * Text cutoff is a known issue, the iOS system does not correctly determine the height of a [UITextView](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextView_Class/) if it is rendered off screen. We are working to fix this bug. 
  * **Workaround:** Adding extra newline characters `\n` at the end of the text key value will artificially increase the rendered UITextView height. 


#### How do I control access to editing with Guided Access?

  * Enable [Guided Access](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202612) in the Settings app.
